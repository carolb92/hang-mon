# Hang 'Mon

A Pokemon-themed guessing game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Guess the Pokemon before your 7 attempts run out, otherwise you'll make Pikachu super sad.

## Features

- **Pokemon Guessing Game**: Guess letters to reveal Pokemon names
- **Filtering Options**: Filter Pokemon by region (Kanto, Johto, etc.) or type (Fire, Water, etc.)
- **Visual Feedback**: See incorrect guesses and remaining attempts
- **Responsive Design**: Responsive UI across all device widths
- **Pokemon Images**: Display Pokemon sprites when successfully guessed

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Pokemon Data**: [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) RESTful API + [pokenode-ts](https://github.com/Gabb-c/pokenode-ts) library for type safety and auto-caching (gotta cache 'em all!)
